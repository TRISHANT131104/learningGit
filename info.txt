    -------------------(adding a file)--------------------------> 
                         ----(edit a file)--->
                                            --(stage the file)-->
                         <----------(commit)---------------------

git commit directly doesn't work since it needs a message to go with it hence the command is (git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE")
git status -> to check status of repo
git checkout filename-> to change the file into the previous commited instance if anything goes wrong
ls -lart -> shows all the hidden items in the repo
git checkout -f -> to change all the files like in the previous commit
git log -> gives your identity and also gives all the commits done by you
